# Download Monitor: momentary updates

## 13.10.2026: from Lua to Swift
> "go through my start menu. If any app is not a Swift app, you need to convert it to a Swift app. We are quitting the Lua, no more Lua, only Swift. And everything will be in the application folder, name of the app in parentheses. Mantra"

MANTRA_STAR apps/download.lua (the star's switch) and the Chrome page become "Download Monitor (Mantra).app", a native
window. The server (monitor.py, :8833) and dlmon.py stay exactly as they are: every session calls them.
**Status:** built v1 13.10.2026; checked against the running server (153 rows). Marko to try.

## 19.10.2026: ON / OFF at the top of the window

> When I select any of the apps, the user interface opens up. In the top of every user interface, there will now be an on/off switch ... If I say on, I close it's on ... When I just switch the check mark, and that's how I activate it. This is gone. Let's work like this. This is the workflow now.

(MANTRA_MANIFEST modules/swift-apps.md, "ON / OFF at the top of every window"; the star, STAR_SWIFT v5, now only opens apps.)

1. The first row of the main window is ON / OFF in the window's own style, named after what it switches. ON is lit while
   the app runs; OFF stops the engine cleanly and quits the app. — **Status:** started
2. Closing the window leaves the app ON; the reopen (a click in the star or the Dock) shows the window again; `--login`
   still starts without a window. — **Status:** started

> please unify the position of the close button on every application. It's far upper right corner. There is X to close the dialog in every dialog, same.

3. An ✕ at the window's far upper-right corner, on the ON / OFF row (ON / OFF at the left, ✕ at the right), grey; it
   closes the window only, the app stays ON. Every other dialog the app opens gets the same ✕. The title bar and its
   traffic lights stay as they are. — **Status:** started
